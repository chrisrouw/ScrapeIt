                                    <div class="paragraph"><span>Isaac has a Zoom
                                            meeting with his teacher and classmates
                                            every Monday/Tuesday for approximately
                                            thirty minutes. It has been really fun
                                            for me to see Isaac in action in the
                                            classroom while he's sitting at our
                                            kitchen table. On occasion, he will
                                            answer questions by grabbing something
                                            in the refrigerator or freezer. One day
                                            he grabbed a jar of jelly when he needed
                                            to think of a word that started with the
                                            letter J, for example. Another time he
                                            grabbed something out of the freezer,
                                            looked at how to spell it, and typed it
                                            into his speech
                                            device.&nbsp;</span><br /><br />He's
                                        smart.&nbsp;<br /><br /><span>Earlier in
                                            November, the teacher showed the
                                            students a picture of a rake and asked
                                            if anyone knew the name of the tool that
                                            is used to gather leaves or move leaves.
                                            (I don't remember the exact wording, but
                                            this was pretty close.)
                                        </span><br /><br /><span>Isaac said,
                                            "Sweeper." He said it so softly that I
                                            don't believe he was heard. Then another
                                            student said something funny, and I
                                            don't think Isaac ever repeated himself.
                                            And typically he wouldn't repeat himself
                                            unless someone asked him to say a word
                                            again. </span><br /><br /><span>Isaac
                                            can identify a rake, so I was surprised
                                            he didn't say rake. I admit, I wondered
                                            what he was
                                            thinking.&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span>The
                                            next day when the teacher showed the
                                            same rake picture (which Isaac ignored,
                                            more or less) and asked the students the
                                            same question, Isaac didn't say
                                            anything. Instead, he jumped up and
                                            opened our garage door, which was
                                            directly behind him through the kitchen
                                            window. I think he thought the teacher
                                            would be able to see it.
                                        </span><br /><br /><span>"I'm sorry, I can't
                                            see what you want me to see, Isaac," the
                                            teacher
                                            said.</span><br /><br /><span>"He opened
                                            the garage door so you could see the
                                            rake," I explained. "It's hanging up in
                                            our garage."
                                        </span><br /><br /><span>But that really
                                            wasn't true, I realized later. A wide
                                            broom hangs in our garage. A rake is on
                                            the other side of the garage, propped up
                                            against the wall. There's no way anyone
                                            could have seen the rake from that
                                            angle. </span><br /><br /><span>When
                                            Isaac and I were in the garage later
                                            that day, I pointed out the rake and
                                            said, "The rake is over there. That's
                                            what your teacher was talking about the
                                            other day."
                                        </span><br /><br /><span>"Yes," Isaac said.
                                            I'm sure he was annoyed even if he
                                            didn't sound like it.
                                        </span><br /><br /><span>It wasn't until
                                            much later that I realized what had
                                            happened. </span><br /><br /><span>The
                                            teacher asked, "What tool do we use to
                                            gather leaves or move leaves?" Isaac
                                            didn't care about the picture of the
                                            rake. He just listened to the question
                                            and thought about his own
                                            experience.&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span>I
                                            took this picture and sent it to the
                                            teacher along with this email. </span>

                                    <div class="paragraph">&#8203;"This is what
                                        Isaac uses instead of a rake to keep the
                                        leaves out of the garage. He's quite a
                                        fanatic about keeping the leaves away from
                                        the garage door. When he opened the garage
                                        door earlier in November to show you the
                                        tool hanging up, this was it. He calls it
                                        'the sweeper.' It's definitely not a rake,
                                        but it's what he uses to move the
                                        leaves."<br /><br />The teacher, whom we
                                        love, responded. He's been teaching Isaac
                                        for a few years and knows him
                                        well.&nbsp;<br /><br />"Ha ha. That is
                                        awesome. Yet another situation where Isaac
                                        answers a question in a way that causes me
                                        to question other possible ways to think of
                                        the question.<br /><br />I have really been
                                        enjoying getting a glimpse at another mode
                                        Isaac uses for communication. At school we
                                        don't see him going to grab things to show
                                        us his answer often, so it has been really
                                        cool watching him use his resources to
                                        answer questions."&nbsp;&#8203;<br /><br />I
                                        guess Isaac was right. A sweeper is used to
                                        move leaves --- when trying to keep the
                                        garage clean.&nbsp;</div>
